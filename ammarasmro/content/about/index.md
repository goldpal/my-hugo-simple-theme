I just finished my master of engineering program, my focus was on Software engineering & Intelligent Systems. I'm interested in building solutions, explore new software engineering techniques, and solve problems. A big part of my program was related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I built few projects using them too.

<!-- ![This is me][1] -->

I'm looking for a place that will allow me to practice and develop the skills that I have acquired so far. Facing new challenges every day drives me to learn new techniques, algorithms, and programming languages. The perfect fit for me would be a company that is interested in exploring new areas and solving a variety set of problems.

#### Education
